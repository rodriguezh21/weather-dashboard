# Weather Dashboard
## Homework #6

### Description

The goal of this activity is to create an informative and accurate weather dashboard that works by inputing the city name and displaying the following:

- The city and date
- The weather icon
- The current temperature
- The wind conditions
- The UV Index with color scale 
- And a 5-day forecast that shows the upcoming temperature and humidity for each day

### About this homework

Very challenging indeed! It truly has been the hardest assignment yet. The most challenging part was definetly the 5-day forecast because it was only provided in 3-hour increments for a total of 120 hours which is equivalent to 5 days. Aside from that the icons were also giving me a hard time. I feel very pleased with the css work, I decided to try a gradient from light orange to dark blue to emulate a sunrise.
